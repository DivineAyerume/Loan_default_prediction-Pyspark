## Business Problem
Many people and businesses depend on loans to meet their financial requirements, However, one major challenge that confronts lending businesses is Identifying applicants who are likely to default on loan payments. A business runs the risk of losing money when it lends money to someone who is likely to default, and when it refuses a loan to someone who is likely to payback, it loses potential revenue. Machine learning offers a solution to this problem with several algorithms that can predict the outcome of a target variable.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the “Lending Club Loans” dataset, which was obtained from [dataworld.io](https://data.world/jaypeedevlin/lending-club-loan-data-2007-11/workspace/file?filename=lending_club_loans.csvhttps://data.world/jaypeedevlin/lending-club-loan-data-2007-11/workspace/file?filename=lending_club_loans.csv).. The dataset contains information about prior loan applicants, including both personal and financial information, as well as the eventual outcome of the loan (whether the applicant “defaulted” or not), which is the target variable. The Original dataset recorded 42542 observations and 115 variables, however, for the purpose of this project only 22 variables were found to be relevant.
